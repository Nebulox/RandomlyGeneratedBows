  "description" : "This is a mod that adds randomly generated bows, with unique alt abilities, and more functions to their primaries!\n\n[h1]Primary Ability Changes:[/h1]\n- Primary has custom cursor animations for chargeup\n- Arrows inherit random colours and shape\n- Arrows can stick into enemies and deal DoT\n- When airborne (off ground) you gain a 1.25x multiplier to all damage on the primary (inherits to DoT on arrow sticking)\n- Custom Sound effects for drawing the string, firing and ready pings\n- Ready ping occurs just before perfect shot is ready, so there is an audible indicator and a visual one\n- Perfect shots have a longer time in between shots\n- Energy is used drawing the bow, and holding, no energy consumed upon firing\n  - Upon running out of energy middraw, automatically fire\n- Faster cooldowns\n- Forces walking while firing\n- Optional extra functions for custom bow creation\n- Custom loosed frames after firing an arrow\n- Elemental perfect arrows\n  - Physical pierces enemies and hits harder\n  - Ice sticks into enemies and slows\n  - Fire explodes and leaves a fire cloud\n  - Poison pierces, leaving poison clouds in its trail, and leaving a larger one on death\n  - Electric shoots at enemies it passes by, by tethering lightning to them, pierces\n\n[h1]Alt Abilities:[/h1]\n[b]Dead Eye:[/b]\n- Mark an enemy and lock on\n- Auto predicts where to fire, and auto aims, so that the arrow should hit\n  - If enemy jumps or moves faster, it may miss\n- Works like normal bowshot if no entity is marked, but aims up a little so that the arrow passes through the cursor\n[b]Arrow Storm:[/b]\n- Long charge up, aims upward, similar to zenshot\n- Fires a single arrow that splits into 5-10 arrows (different for each bow with this alt)\n- Arrows fall and rain down on cursor\n- Split angles and such are random for each bow\n[b]Backpedal:[/b]\n- Jump backwards in a flip\n- Invincible during\n- Smaller hitbox\n- Uses small amounts of energy\n- Can only recharge when grounded\n[b]Blink Arrow:[/b]\n- Charges up a teleportation arrow\n- Teleports player to where it lands\n- Charge increases zone of teleportation (full charge wont teleport when aimed near player)\n- Explodes dealing alot of damage\n- Can teleport player really high up\n[b]Nock Alternate Arrow:[/b]\n- Can nock different arrows to primary fire\n  - Nock more arrows:\n    - Increases draw time and adds many more arrows to primary fire\n  - Nock rebounding arrow:\n    - Nocks a bouncing arrow for the primary fire\n\n[h1]Uniques:[/h1]\n- Artemis\n  - A large bulky bow that slings heavy arrows that return after a bit like a boomerang\n\n[h1]How to obtain:[/h1]\n- Random bows spawn randomly in chests, like normal weapons\n- ID's are \"neb-commonbow\", \"neb-uncommonbow\", \"neb-rarebow\"\n  - Prefixed to avoid conflict\n- Artemis is not yet obtainable, can be spawned with /spawnitem neb-artemis\n\n[h1]Notes:[/h1]\n- There will be a version of this mod integrated into FU soon, modifying all of its bows, this is a big process please be patient\n- This version will not work along side that version, so keep that in mind\n- If you find an errors or bugs, or have suggestions for some altfires leave them in their respective discussions\n- This mod should be compatible with all other mods\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070120146]Aegonian[/url]: Made the base of some scripts and helped in other places\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561193731158938]Degranon[/url]: Did the calculations for arrow rain, and helped with other various scripting\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace/]I the great one, Nebulox[/url]: Made the rest of the mod, sfx, spriting, and abilties\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/loiber]Loib[/url]: Assisted with sprites and ideas for the random bows\n\n[h1]I CAN BREATH![/h1]\nHello there...  I made this mod months ago, before I lost my pc, this mod contains a lot and is a WIP, if it is liked, and there is enough demand i will add more alts and uniques. On that matter, it is becoming a part of FU because I plan on reworking some of their weapons, to be more smooth and streamlined, like what I did with these bows.\n\n[h1]Github Repo:[/h1]\nYou can get the nonsteam, github version [url=]here.[/url]",
